# Minutes of 28 November 2023

- Enos Nemukula: Research Lead
- Faith Mabushe: Team Leader
- Ralph Matumba: Secretary
- Philemon Ralukake: TBD

- We gave a presentation on the preliminary approach we're going to use to solve the problem.
    - We will also want to consider different models, and models that factor physics principles in their application.

- The team agreed on a team name: Phynance (**Phy**sics, Fi**nance**)

- Ralph, the secretary, set up an Overleaf template using IEEE conference format for the project report, and setting up the rest of the repository.

- Overleaf requires premium membership for adding more than 2 collaborators. We opted to host the LaTeX report source code GitHub instead.

- Enos realised that we had not yet factored in any physics principles to the models we're researching.

- Ralph resigned as Secretary at the end of the day to take on a Project Coordinator role. Philemon shall take over as secretary.
